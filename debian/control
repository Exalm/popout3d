Description: Creates 3D images from photographs taken with an ordinary camera.
 Take a set of photos of a subject and the software will create a 3D image from
 each pair of photos in the set, so that you can choose the best. Vertical and 
 rotational alignment of the left and right images is essential for a convincing
 3D effect, but difficult to achieve with an ordinary camera. The software 
 corrects any misalignment. Formats available are anaglyph (red/cyan), 
 side-by-side and crossover. Several sets of photos can be processed at once, 
 they can be previewed and poor ones can be deleted.
