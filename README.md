# popout3d-1
Popout3D creates 3D images from photographs taken with an ordinary camera.


The original application has been much improved. 

It was originally built on Gmome 3.30, but that is now end-of-life and the application won't build on 3.36 or 3.38.

The main part of the application still builds as do the first 6 modules of the dependency, but the final one, align-image-stack, doesn't.

Would you be interested in trying to find the problem Alex?
